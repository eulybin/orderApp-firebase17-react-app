# orderApp-firebase17-react-app
Functionality: Custom Hooks, Async/Await, Firebase, Http Requests, Forms
In this app I expand on a previous repository: 'foodOrder-react-app'. I add some extra functionality such as fetching the meals from Firebase on page load and adding a form once the order is placed so that the user is able to add some contact and address information.
